#  Modular Machine Learning Models for Classification and Clustering using BloodMNIST

A comprehensive machine learning project featuring modular implementations for classification and clustering. The project applies ridge regression, nearest neighbors, logistic regression, and unsupervised clustering techniques, evaluated on BloodMNIST and UCI HAR datasets.

---

This project presents a modular implementation of machine learning models for both classification and clustering tasks, developed as part of an applied learning exercise. The key objective is to demonstrate a solid understanding of core ML techniques using real-world datasets.

The Jupyter notebook integrates supervised and unsupervised learning approaches:

Polynomial basis function modeling and ridge regression for predictive tasks.

K-means clustering combined with PCA for unsupervised data exploration.

Nearest neighbor and logistic regression models for image classification on BloodMNIST.

A linear model for human activity recognition using the UCI HAR dataset.

The codebase is structured for flexibility, allowing easy experimentation with parameters and models. Each model is evaluated through accuracy, confusion matrices, and visualization techniques, with results documented both programmatically and visually.

## Key Achievements
Developed a fully working ML pipeline in Python without high-level frameworks (e.g., no scikit-learn for core models).

Achieved strong classification performance on the BloodMNIST dataset using logistic regression and regularized models.

Successfully applied unsupervised clustering techniques with PCA to visualize complex high-dimensional data.

Demonstrated the ability to generalize and apply similar modeling techniques to a second domain (human activity recognition).
